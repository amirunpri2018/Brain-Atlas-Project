    "- **Category:** Module to add spatial invariance.\n",
    "- **Context:** Addition of a spatial transformer module to spatially manipulate data within a network. The spatial transformer module is a dynamic mechanism that can actively spatially transform an image (or a feature map) by producing an appropriate transformation for each input sample. The transformation is then performed on the entire feature map (non-locally) and can include scaling, cropping, rotations, as well as non-rigid deformations. Can be used for:\n",
    "  - image classification\n",
    "  - co-localization\n",
    "  - spatial attention.\n",
    "- **Correctness:** With a lot of training data, the method should be feasible.\n",
    "- **Contributions:** Module that can be trained using back-prop; en-to-end training; no change in loss function is required.\n",
    "- **Clarity:** Well written paper validated with experiments on a few datasets"
